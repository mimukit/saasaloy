# SaasAloy - Open-source AI SaaS starter kit

SaasAloy is an enterprise-grade, open-source SaaS starter kit designed for 2026's "Native-AI" landscape, prioritizing data sovereignty and agentic autonomy without the typical "platform tax" of proprietary boilerplates.

Built on a nomorepo foundation with a modular, framework-agnostic component architecture, the project secures multi-tenancy at the database layer using Postgres Row-Level Security (RLS) and integrates the Vercel AI SDK for autonomous reasoning loops. By providing a sovereign pgvector RAG pipeline and a high-performance AI usage ledger for real-time token tracking and billing, SaasAloy enables B2B developers to launch privacy-compliant, scalable AI applications that remain fully portable via Docker.
